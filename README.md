<h2>What is BlackBox</h2>
    BlackBox is electronic equipment designed for learning and adventure events.
    one of the most important BlackBox features is storage for locking something.
    It can be controlled directly or for example via your smartphone.

<h3>Peripheri of BlackBox</h3>
    BlackBox has many systems, such as sensors and output peripherals, for example, the light circle or possible wireless communication. 

<h4>Pressure pad</h4>
    BlackBox contains a unique pressure pad, that you can also use like micro weight.

<h2>Examples of using</h2>
    In gaming in nature, you can replace an instructor with BlackBox on a game station.
    Thanks to his abilities, BlackBox is good for learning or teaching programming.

<h2>Lantern</h2>
    We also designed a Latern: a immovable variant of BlackBox for static installations
    The Lantern has four different storages. You can use them, e.g., for four teams in games.

<h2>Real using</h2>
    BlackBox was first used in 2019, By 2020 at least 110 children played a game with it.
    Based of the feedback, we designed a new device - Lantern - in 2021. 
    Both devices have over 320 enthusiastic users on many children camps or adventure games.
    Both devices were used in the bachelor thesis of Karolina Mikešová: "Using Modern Technologies in Camp Pedagogy".
